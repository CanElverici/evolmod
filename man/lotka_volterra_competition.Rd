\usage{
lotka_volterra_competition(initial_conditions, parameters, time)
}
\arguments{
\item{initial_conditions}{A vector of initial conditions for the model stating the initial population of species 1 and species 2.}

\item{parameters}{A vector of parameters for the model stating the intrinsic growth rate of species 1 (r1), the intrinsic growth rate of species 2 (r2), the carrying capacity of species 1 (K1), the carrying capacity of species 2 (K2), the competition coefficient of species 1 (alpha), and the competition coefficient of species 2 (beta).}

\item{time}{A vector of time points to solve the model at}
}
\value{
A data frame with the time points and the population of species 1 and species 2 at each time point.
